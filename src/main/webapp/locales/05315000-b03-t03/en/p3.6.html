    The closed courtyard complex reached in brick was built in 1896 as the successor to the older Petershof (Wendelinstra√üe 67). At the beginning of the 20th Century, the Cologne banker Ernst Koenigs was the owner. Count Adelmann von Adelmannsfelden lived there for several years, government president in Cologne from 1922-1926. Since 1926, the court has belonged to the city of Cologne and has housed a municipal daycare centre since 1945. For a long time, there were workshops of the Green Space Office in the economic buildings.

    In 1839, the House Belvedere (Belvederestraße 147) was built in the style of a classicist country house as a reception building of the station of the Rheinische Eisenbahngesellschaft. This station originally formed the end point of a 7 km long route, which had its starting point in Thürmchenswall station. From here you had a "beautiful view" (Belvedere) of the cathedral city. With the expansion of the railway line to Aachen and then Antwerp, the station lost increasing importance and was still in the 19th century. Century shut down. Since the end of the 19th Century, the city of Cologne is the owner.

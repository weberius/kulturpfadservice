    On this corner plot, the architect Oswald Mathias Ungers (1926 to 2007) built his residential building with two separate apartments and an office in 1958/59. With the use of exposed concrete and clinker in the cubically interlocking buildings, the building represented the beginning of a new architectural language in Germany. The library cube from basalt lava has been joining Quadrather Stra√üe since 1990. The "Ungers Archive for Architectural Science (UAA)" is located here. Both buildings are under monument protection.

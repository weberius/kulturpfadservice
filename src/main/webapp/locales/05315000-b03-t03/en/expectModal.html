            Müngersdorf was first mentioned in a document in 980 as "mundestorp". In the Middle Ages, the place was the property of the Cologne Apostles's monastery as a glory. Müngersdorf has largely retained its village character in its core area to this day. In addition to the church, numerous larger courtyards as well as former small farms and agricultural workers' houses are particularly representative. From the 1920s, a strong construction activity stored around the old town centre with villars and larger single-family houses began. Particularly noteworthy are the houses of important Cologne artists and architects.

    From 1261 to 1803, the church courtyard was one of the possessions of the Cistercian Abbey of Altenberg. At that time, generous lands enrounged the estate. A document of 1608 quantifies the agricultural area of the farm with a total of 162 acres of land, which was later claimed for settlement purposes and in the construction of the MÃ¼ngersdorf stadium. Today's closed courtyard comes from the 18th and 19th centuries. Century. The manor house with a roof, the interior of which is preserved almost unchanged, dates from 1774. After secularisation (1803), the farm came into private ownership.

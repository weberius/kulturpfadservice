In November 2010, the Hanns-Dieter-Hüsch-Bildungszentrum unified the library, city archive, adult education center, and cultural office. The first public library in Moers was established in 1852 as a private foundation to commemorate 150 years of Prussian affiliation and was inaugurated with the permission of King Friedrich Wilhelm IV as the “Friedrich Wilhelms-Volksbibliothek.” This library aimed to provide the lower classes with opportunities for practical, moral, and patriotic education. The initial collection comprised approximately 1,000 titles, nearly a quarter of which were religious texts, funded by donations from publishers, Moers citizens, and a gift from the king.

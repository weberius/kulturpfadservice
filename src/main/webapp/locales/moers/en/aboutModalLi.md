# About the Project

The “Moers Tour” features 35 historical stations and 12 commemorative plaques that vividly present the city’s history through its architectural landmarks, places of memory, and special features. The tour begins at Altmarkt – the medieval core of Moers.

This particular route does not include all stations created by the history workshop, but instead offers a compact circuit focused on the city center that can be completed in less than one hour.

The stations are not visited in chronological order; instead, the route was designed to be easy to follow and to avoid heavy traffic areas.

The tour invites participants to explore the city and its cultural-historical landmarks on their own or in a group using a smartphone or camera – encouraging shared experiences and conversations about the city’s character. The plaques in the urban space serve as reference points for orientation.

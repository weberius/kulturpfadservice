<p>
    This farm is a new building of the year 1862, i.e. without a mediaeval predecessor building like the other courtyards in Lövenich. The builder of the closed courtyard built according to the Franconian model was L. Zaun, who gave the farm a Hungarian name in memory of his hunts in the Carpathians. Stylistically, the late-classic mansion corresponds to numerous mansions in the surrounding area of Cologne with its strict axial structure and emphasis by a central gable. Almost identical to Haus Közal is a farm complex in Freimersdorf, a former property of the Zaun family.

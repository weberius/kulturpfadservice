            The Tour 1 of the Kulturpfad, starting from the Müngersdorfer Stadium, leads to the western suburbs of Cologne, which were only incorporated in 1975, some of which have still retained their rural character. Junkersdorf, which is first mentioned in a document in 962 as "Gunterersthorp", has its village core area around the Statthalterhof and the old village church. In the Middle Ages, the Cologne Antoniters were the owners of the "herfulness" Junkersdorf. The expansion of the place as a "garden city" began in the late 1920s with the construction of noble single-family houses. The pasture, now dominated by high-rise buildings in the core area, was originally only an insignificant street settlement. From 1906, it was expanded from Cologne into a villa colony, which has largely been preserved in the area around Emil-Schreiterer-Platz. The once independent village of Üsdorf also belongs to Weiden. The town of Lövenich is already mentioned in a document around 1000 with the church of St. Severin. Since the 2nd Half of the 14th Century, it is in the possession of the Order of St. John with the largest courts. Despite numerous new development areas, Lövenich has been able to maintain its character as a village characterised by farms to this day. Almost intact, Widdersdorf largely gives the impression of a village in the surrounding area of Cologne. Especially around the church, numerous important courtyards as well as smaller old houses are grouped. The place is already mentioned as "Wichenthorpe" in 1136.

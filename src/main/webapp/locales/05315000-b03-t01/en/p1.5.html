    In the first documentary mention of 1466, the chapel belonged to the Cologne Mariengradenstift. After a destruction, it was rebuilt in 1669 as a simple hall building. The St. Stephanus' consecrated house of worship was integrated into the complex of the now demolished Engelshof until the 1960s. It is planned to include the chapel in a new development and return to its original use.

    The liber valoris (around 1274) confirms for the first time a church in Widdersdorf, which was incorporated from 1494 to 1802 the abbey of Brauweiler. In 1745, the current church was built, a one-nave brick building with a three-sided closed choir and west tower. Inside, original pieces of equipment from the building period are preserved. Next to the church are the rectory of 1775 and the old village cemetery with tombstones from the 17th. Century.

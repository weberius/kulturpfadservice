    On a slight hill, surrounded by the old village cemetery, the former village church, which is now used as a kindergarten, is located in the middle of the village centre of Junkersdorf. A church at this place is first mentioned in 1223, but it can be assumed that a church already existed here in 898. In 1324, the church is incorporated into the Cologne Gereonsstift. In 1676, a far-reaching destruction of the interior was carried out by fire. Another fire, 1754, leaves the church only near the choir. During the reconstruction, the church receives the current west tower. Middle of the 19th In the 19th century, the church was expanded into a basilica.

    The Roman family tomb discovered in 1843, which belonged to an undiscovered manor, is one of the most elaborate tombs known today in the Gallic-Germanic provinces. The once probably two-storey burial chamber was built in the middle of the 2nd. Century A.D. The building dug into the earth made of tuff blocks and with sandstone door is divided inside on three sides by niches. The original equipment has also been preserved: 3 busts made of marble (end of 2. Century) and two wicker chairs simulated in limestone. The seasonal sarcophagus (end of 3. Century) once stood outside the chamber. In 1844, the superstructure and the guardian house were built according to plans by the cathedral master builder Ernst Friedrich Zwirner.

    If you follow an old tradition, then the Fronhof goes back to a gift from Empress Helena in the year 345. In 1330, the Cologne Gereonsstift is named as the owner. Through the Middle Ages, the court was also the seat of the court. An inscription dates the powerful baroque analge, which in its unity follows the Franconian construction method, to the year 1718.

    From the 18th Century also originates the chapel opposite the main entrance with original equipment, which forms a unique ensemble with the courtyard.

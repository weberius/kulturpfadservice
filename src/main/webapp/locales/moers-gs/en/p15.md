The exact origins of the Moers New Town are not well-documented, but a document from 1448 suggests its existence. This New Town was connected to the Old Town through the Neutor, although the exact construction date of the gate remains unknown. The Neutor was demolished in 1836, and today, only the street name “Neutorplatz” serves as a reminder of its former location.

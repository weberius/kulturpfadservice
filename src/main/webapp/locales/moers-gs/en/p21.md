The Gymnasium Adolfinum was founded in 1582 by Count Adolf of Neuenahr-Moers and has undergone numerous changes and existential threats throughout its over 430-year history. Originally conceived as a “schola illustris,” a type of school positioned between a Latin school and a university, its curriculum focused on classical languages, particularly to prepare students for university studies. Following various political and structural transformations, including its downgrade to a Progymnasium in 1821 and the reinstatement of its full gymnasium status in 1874, the school moved into a new building on Homberger Straße in 1898. During World War II, the school building was destroyed in 1944 but rebuilt by 1951; today, the gymnasium emphasizes both classical languages and sciences.

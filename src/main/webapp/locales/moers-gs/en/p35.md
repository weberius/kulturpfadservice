The Moers Cemetery on Klever Straße was established in 1883, replacing the old cemetery on Rheinberger Straße. Covering approximately 3 hectares with around 3,500 graves, it remains the primary burial site for residents of Moers’ city center, supplemented since 1971 by the main cemetery in Hülsdonk. Adjacent is the Honorary Cemetery, inaugurated on June 13, 1915, containing graves of 60 fallen soldiers from World War I and 92 victims of World War II. To the north lies the Jewish Cemetery, established in the 19th century and now serving as a memorial; it was desecrated multiple times during the Nazi era but was partially restored after 1945.

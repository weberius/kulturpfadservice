The triangular area between the star-shaped embankment and the narrow city moat was once a ravelin of the Orange fortress of Moers, constructed in the early 17th century under Maurice of Orange. This outwork, designed by Simon Stevin, was intended to repel attacks across the water surfaces and was characterized by sharp-angled bastions and the use of locally excavated earth, distinguishing it from older fortress constructions. The citadel was separated from the city by a water moat that turned westward in front of the current courthouse facade, crossed Kastellplatz, and met the moat dividing the old and new towns at the city church. Following the demolition of the fortress ordered by Frederick the Great in 1763, the ramparts were leveled and the earth was used to fill the moats, causing the water surfaces between the city districts and the citadel to disappear and leading to the creation of the present-day castle park area.

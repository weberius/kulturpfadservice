The Moers fortress comprised the citadel with the castle, the old town, and the new town, separated by bodies of water but surrounded by a unified moat system with ravelins, forming an almost regular pentagon. This design, planned by Simon Stevin in the Dutch style, significantly improved defensive capabilities compared to the old turreted city wall, which offered an unfavorable field of fire. In 1763, Frederick the Great ordered the dismantling of the fortress; the ramparts were leveled, and the earth was used to fill the moats, creating building land and areas for the future castle park. The preserved embankment, originally intended as flood protection, now forms, with its tree-lined avenue, the scenic and urban framework of the city.

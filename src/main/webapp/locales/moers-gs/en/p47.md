The headquarters of ENNI Energie & Umwelt Niederrhein GmbH (ENNI) on Uerdinger Straße marks the origin of Moers’ energy supply, which began in 1873 with the construction of the gasworks at this location. The municipal utilities of Moers, founded in 1894, were based here for over a century until the cities of Moers and Neukirchen-Vluyn jointly established ENNI in 2000. Since the company’s founding in 2011, ENNI has offered numerous supply and disposal services as well as leisure activities in Moers and Neukirchen-Vluyn through various subsidiaries. With the company’s development, the site on Uerdinger Straße has also changed; the large gas holders have disappeared, and in the 1980s, a residential area and the current administrative building of ENNI were built.

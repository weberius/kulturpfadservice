Over its more than 700-year history, the town hall of Moers has been located at various sites. Before 1610, the city acquired a representative townhouse built in 1491 on Steinstraße next to the Meertor and, after modifications and expansions, used it as the town hall; following the construction of the Dutch fortifications (1611–1620), the Meertor was repurposed as the town hall tower. In 1954, a new town hall was inaugurated on the north side of Neumarkt, after plans for a new building at this location in 1913 were thwarted by World War I. In 1984, the city took over the district administration building constructed in 1962 near the castle park as the “New Town Hall,” until the previously renovated “Old Town Hall” with a modern extension was reoccupied in 2012.

The castle park was created in the 19th century as a landscaped garden on the former fortress grounds, after Frederick II of Prussia ordered the demolition of the Moers fortress in 1763/64 and sold the land as garden plots. Wealthy families acquired large properties around the castle; in 1836, industrialist Friedrich Wintgens commissioned a park designed by Maximilian Friedrich Weyhe, encompassing the eastern half of the fortress grounds. In 1874, Peter Hermann Nickertz designed the western part of the park with a denser network of paths and exotic trees. The city of Moers acquired the castle and the western part of the park in 1905, and the eastern part in 1913, opening both to the public by 1914; in 1933, the district administratorâ€™s garden was added, resulting in a significant landscaped park.
